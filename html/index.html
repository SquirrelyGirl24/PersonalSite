      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>Born & raised in Albany, NY, I joined the Navy in 2002. I spent the first 6 years of my career as a Radar Operator and the last 6 years as a Command Career Counselor. My last duty station assignment brought me to Colorado in 2013, where I finished my time on active duty in September of 2014. Since getting out of the Navy, I have been attending school for most of that time. Schools include the Art Institute of Colorado, Denver School of Massage Therapy, Community College of Aurora and currently, Skill Distillery. Prior to the Navy, I was an Administrative Assistant and Customer Service Representative for 8 years.</p>
